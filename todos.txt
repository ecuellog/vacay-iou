TODOS:
- Have consistent error handling in back end.
- Make sure all errors are handled gracefully.
- Logout:
    Front-end: delete the cookies.
    Back-end: Delete refresh token from user.

-Bug: After a while, user can access dashboard, but the request to get all ledgers returns 401 (Unauthorized)
-Bug: When refresh token expires, invalid refresh token.
