TODOS:
- Have consistent error handling in back end.
- Make sure all errors are handled gracefully.
- Logout:
    Front-end: delete the cookies.
    Back-end: Delete refresh token from user.
- Bug: After a while, user can access dashboard, but the request to get all ledgers returns 401 (Unauthorized)
- Bug: When refresh token expires, invalid refresh token. (err: Refresh token invalid).
- When creating a new ledger, add the creator's name to the person array.
- Deal with rounding issues.

FOR FUTURE:
- Have an array of refresh tokens instead of just one so that users can have multiple sessions open.
- Check if random number generated for ID's is already present on database?
